## Contributing

The markdown files are generated automatically via [mdgen](https://github.com/Seasawher/mdgen).
Thus, if you're going to write or fix content for the book, please do so in the original Lean files inside the [lean](lean) directory.

**Important**: since `mdgen` is so simple, please avoid using comment sections
in Lean code blocks with `/- ... -/`. If you want to insert commentaries, do so
with double dashes `--`.

### Building the markdown files

This is not required, but if you want to build the markdown files, you can do so by running `lake run build`.
